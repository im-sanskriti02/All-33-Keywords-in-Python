# All-33-Keywords-in-Python
1. And - and is a logical operator, it returns True when both the condition / operands are true.

2. As - it is used to create an alias (it is a second name for a piece of data or we can say shortform), we use aliasing when we use same module/variable again and again in the program.

3. Assert - It lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError. You can write a message to be written if the code returns False. 
While running our code in python, whenever complier finds any error it stop running the program. So if we are not sure about any part of our code and to prevent it from stop running we use asssert if in case the conditon returns false it raise an AssertionError.

4. Break - It is use to exit from the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement.
The most common use for break is when some condition is achieved and you require to exit from a loop and execute the next statemnet after break.

5. Class - Class keyword is used to define a class.

6. Continue - Continue is also a loop control statement just like the break statement. Continue statement is opposite to that of break statement, instead of terminating the loop, it forces to execute the next iteration of the loop.
As the name suggests the continue statement forces the loop to continue or execute the next iteration. When the continue statement is executed in the loop, the code inside the loop following the continue statement will be skipped and the next iteration of the loop will begin.

7. Def - Def keyword is used to define a function.

8. Del - Del keyword is used to delete objects.

9. Elif - Elif keyword is a way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

10. Else -  An else statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement gives a FALSE value. The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at most only one else statement following if.

11. Except- The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions. Python executes code following the try statement as a normal part of the program. The code that follows the except statement is the program’s response to any exceptions in the preceding try clause.

12. False - It is a boolean value,it is the result of comparison operations. The False keyword is the same as 0.

13. Finally - The finally keyword is used in try...except blocks. It defines a block of code to run when the try...except...else block is final. The finally block will be executed no matter if the try block raises an error or not.

14. For - A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

15. From - The from keyword is used to import only a specified section from a module.        

16. Global - Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables. Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. 
To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

17. If - If is a decision making statement, it tests a certain condition and if that condition satisfied the code block of if while execute. Otherwise else code block will be executed if available.
Remember to give proper indentation while writting code block for if statement.

18. Import - Import keyword is use to import a module. You can consider a module to be the same as a code library.A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
Create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py


19. In - The in keyword has two purposes,first it is used to check if a value is present in a sequence (list, range, string etc.). Second it is also used to iterate through a sequence in a for loop.


20. Is - The is keyword is used to test if two variables refer to the same object. The test returns True if the two objects are the same object.The test returns False if they are not the same object, even if the two objects are 100% equal. We use == operator to test if two variables are equal.

21. Lambda - The lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python.
This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.
You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.
It is different from normal function in python.
We can also use lambda() function with filters, map, reduce.

22. None - None is used to define a null value. It is not the same as an empty string, False, or a zero. It is a data type of the class NoneType object. 
Assigning a value of None to a variable is one way to reset it to its original, empty state.
Note : If a function does not return anything, it returns None in python.

23. Nonlocal -This keyword works similar to the global, but rather than global, this keyword declares a variable to point to variable of outside enclosing function, in case of nested functions.

24. Not - The not keyword is a logical operator. The return value will be True if the statement(s) are not True, otherwise it will return False.

25. Or - Or is a logical operator which returns True if one of the statements is true.

26. Pass - This statement simply does nothing. The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute. It is like null operation, as nothing will happen is it is executed. Pass statement can also be used for writing empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statement, function and classes.

27. Raise - We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. The statement can be complemented with a custom exception. The program comes to a halt and displays our exception to screen, offering clues about what went wrong.

28. Return - A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.
Remember Return statement can not be used outside the function.

29. True - The True keyword is a Boolean value, and result of a comparison operation. The True keyword is the same as 1.

30. Try -The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions. Python executes code following the try statement as a normal part of the program. The code that follows the except statement is the program’s response to any exceptions in the preceding try clause.

31. While - While is a primitive loop. With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

32. With -The with statement in Python is used for resource management and exception handling. You’d most likely find it when working with file streams. Like, the statement ensures that the file stream process doesn’t block other processes if an exception is raised, but terminates properly.

33. Yield - The yield keyword in python works like a return, but the only difference is that instead of returning a value, it gives back a generator object to the caller.
When a function is called and the thread of execution finds a yield keyword in the function, the function execution stops at that line itself and it returns a generator object back to the caller.
